# Quarto demo project

This project contains some quarto files to play with.

In the following I describe the files:

## `/documents`

- `penguin_paper_basic.qmd`: Basic Quarto document. Shows the basic YAML elements, 
Markdown elements and R code chunks

- `penguin_paper_complex.qmd`: A more advanced version of `penguin_paper_basic` that also includes
cross-referencing of figures and tables, citations and a more complex yaml header

- `fancy_html.qmd`: An example of how to create nice HTML tables and interactive plots

- `python_example.qmd`: An example with Python code

## `/presentations`

- `penguin_presentation1.qmd`: A simple presentation that can be rendered to both powerpoint and HTML (revealjs)
- `penguin_presentation2.qmd`: Includes more HTML stuff like themes, tabsets, slide transitions, ...

## `/R`

- `quarto_functionality.R`: Shows R functions that can be used with quarto package
